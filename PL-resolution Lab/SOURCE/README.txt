- In this lab, I use file jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and python file (.py) to code, 
they are pl_resolution.ipynb and pl_resolution.py. You can choose one of them to 
check the code, or all of them.
- If you want to test the program:
-> By using python file (.py), you must use this command in command prompt (window) 
or terminal (linux, MacOS): python pl_resolution.py
-> By using jupyter notebook file (.ipynb), you must use the jupyter notebook, jupyter 
lab, google Colab or Visual Studio code (have anaconda) to run cell by cell.
******Note: you must put all file input in current path which you are working to run.
